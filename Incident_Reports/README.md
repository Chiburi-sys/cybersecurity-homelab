# Incident Reports

This folder contains structured incident reports based on simulated attacks in the home lab. Each report follows a SOC-style workflow and includes analysis, detection logic, and remediation steps.

## Report Structure
Each report includes:
- Executive summary
- Attack narrative
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Log analysis and detection logic
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Recommended mitigations

## Goal
Demonstrate SOC analyst documentation skills and the ability to analyze and communicate security incidents clearly.
