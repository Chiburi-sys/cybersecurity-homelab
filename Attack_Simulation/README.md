# Attack Simulation Lab

This folder contains offensive security exercises performed in a controlled home lab environment using Kali Linux. These simulations generate telemetry for SIEM ingestion and incident response practice.

## Contents
- brute_force_ssh.md — Hydra SSH brute force attack
- malware_execution.md — Payload execution and behavioral observation
- sql_injection_dvwa.md — SQL injection attack against DVWA
- screenshots/ — Terminal outputs and attack visuals

## Goal
Produce realistic attack data to support detection engineering, log analysis, and incident response workflows.
